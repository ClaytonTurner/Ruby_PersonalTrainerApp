Feature: output information for your completed workout

As a registered user 
So I can view statistics on my completed workouts
I want to view the exercises completed and the duration of each exercise.

Background: Start from the 'Workout' page
	Given the following workouts exist:
	| id | name     | listOfExerciseIds | email            |
	| 1  | workout1 | 1,3,5,1,2,3,1     | myemail@email.com|
	| 2  | workout2 | 1,9,7,1,7,9,1     | myemail@email.com|
	| 3  | workout3 | 1,2,3,1,2,3,1     | myemail@email.com|
	| 4  | workout4 | 1,12,3,1,12,3,1   | myemail@email.com|
	| 5  | workout5 | 1,2,2,1,2,2,1     | other@email.com  |

	Given the following workoutlogs exists:
	| id | workoutId | completedDate | totalTime | email            |
	| 1  | 1         | 03-Nov-2014   | 00:10:00  | myemail@email.com|
	| 2  | 1         | 04-Nov-2014   | 00:10:00  | myemail@email.com|
  | 3  | 5         | 04-Nov-2014   | 00:15:00  | other@email.com  | 
	| 4  | 2         | 15-Nov-2014   | 00:05:00  | myemail@email.com|

	And I am logged in as 'myemail@email.com'
	And I am on the 'My Workouts' page
	

Scenario: see completed exercises
	When I press 'Completed Workouts'
	Then I should be redirected to the 'Completed Workout' page
	And I should see 'workout1: 03-Nov-2014 00:10:00'
	And I should see 'workout1: 04-Nov-2014 00:10:00'
	And I should see 'workout2: 15-Nov-2014 00:05:00'
	And I should see 'Save' button
